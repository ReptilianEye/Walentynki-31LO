# LO31 Walentynki

A (slightly) rushed project to display Valentine's Day messages publicly.

**THIS IS A SIMPLIFIED VERSION WITH REDUCED FUNCTIONALITY.**
The version here closely resembles the setup during Valentine's Day, the main branch only contains a simplified, static frontend.
The version here only contains a simplified, static frontend. For a version that closely resembles the setup during Valentine's Day, see the [archive branch](https://github.com/ReptilianEye/Walentynki-31LO/tree/archive).

The frontend (`/front`) is made using create-react-app with the intention of being deployed to Vercel.

To run the frontend, use `yarn install` in `/front` to install all dependencies and `yarn start` to start a development server. In this version, there is only on main part: `/` (`MessageForm.tsx`) which displays all public messages.
